# MAC
This project aims to create and deploy a 16-bit Multiply-Accumulate (MAC) unit that can handle two inputs. Each input comprises a single sign bit, three integer bits, and twelve fractional bits. The primary objective is to effectively accumulate the product of these inputs while preserving precision throughout the computational process
